# CTFd King Of The Hill Scoreboard

This [CTFd](https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd) plugin changes the default list scoreboard into a "Category" based scoreboard.

The scoreboard is calculated based on:
1) Total number of categories completed in least time
2) Total Score is updated only after a category in completed
